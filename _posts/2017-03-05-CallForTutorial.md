#### Attention
Tutorials at SEAL 2017 will be presented by domain experts to cover current topics relevant to evolutionary computation and learning.

We encourage the inclusion of interactive activities and demos.

Tutorials will be free to all SEAL 2017 attendees. 

### Submission Process
Each tutorial proposal should include:
1. A half-page extended abstract (in plain text) that includes: the title of the tutorial, the name and affiliation of the instructor(s), and a description of the tutorial scope and content.
2. Short bio of the instructor(s) (about half page in plain text).
3. <b>Highly encouraged</b>: A description of any interactive activity or demo planned within the tutorial presentation.

### Reviewing
Tutorial proposals will be reviewed by the SEAL 2017 tutorial chairs, based on the SEAL attendees' likely interest in them, the breadth and depth of the topic(s), and the expertise and credentials of the instructor(s).
