                Title: Evolutionary Computation: A Unified Approach<br>
                Presenter: Prof. Kenneth De Jong<br>
                Contact Information: Krasnow Institute, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, 22030, USA, kdejong@gmu.edu<br>
                Abstract:<br>
                The field of Evolutionary Computation has experienced tremendous growth over the past 20 years, resulting in a wide variety of evolutionary algorithms and applications.  The result poses an interesting dilemma for many practitioners in the sense that, with such a wide variety of algorithms and approaches, it is often hard to see the relationships between them, assess strengths and weaknesses, and make good choices for new application areas.<br>
                This tutorial is intended to give an overview of a general EC framework that can help compare and contrast approaches, encourages crossbreeding, and facilitates intelligent design choices.   The use of this framework is then illustrated by showing how traditional EAs can be compared and contrasted with it, and how new EAs can be effectively designed using it.<br>
                Finally, the framework is used to identify some important open issues that need further research.<br>

                <h3>Tutorial 2</h3>
                Title: Evolutionary Large-Scale Global Optimization: An Introduction<br>
                Presenter: Prof. Xiaodong Li<br>
                Contact Information: School of Science (Computer Science and Software Engineering), RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC 3001, Australia, xiaodong.li@rmit.edu.au<br>
                Abstract:<br>
                Many real-world optimization problems involve a large number of decision variables. The trend in engineering optimization shows that the number of decision variables involved in a typical optimization problem has grown exponentially over the last 50 years, and this trend continues with an ever increasing rate. The proliferation of big-data analytic applications has also resulted in the emergence of large-scale optimization problems at the heart of many machine learning problems. The recent advance in the area of machine learning has also witnessed very large scale optimization problems encountered in training deep neural network architectures (so-called deep learning), some of which have over a billion decision variables. It is this “curse-of-dimensionality” that has made large-scale optimization an exceedingly difficult task. Current optimization methods are often ill-equipped in dealing with such problems. It is this research gap in both theory and practice that has attracted much research interest, making large-scale optimization an active field in recent years. We are currently witnessing a wide range of mathematical and metaheuristics optimization algorithms being developed to overcome this scalability issue. Among these, metaheuristics have gained popularity due to their ability in dealing with black-box optimization problems.<br>
                In this tutorial, we provide an overview of recent advances in the field of evolutionary large-scale global optimization with an emphasis on the divide-and-conquer approaches (a.k.a. decomposition methods). In particular, we give an overview of different approaches including the non-decomposition based approaches such as memetic algorithms and sampling methods to deal with large-scale problems. This is followed by a more detailed treatment of implicit and explicit decomposition algorithms in large-scale optimization. Considering the popularity of decomposition methods in recent years, we provide a detailed technical explanation of the state-of-the-art decomposition algorithms including the differential grouping algorithm and its latest improved derivatives (such as global DG and DG2 algorithms), which outperform other decomposition algorithms on the latest large-scale global optimization benchmarks. We also address the issue of resource allocation in cooperative coevolution and provide a detailed explanation of some recent algorithms such as the contribution-based cooperative co-evolution family of algorithms. Overall, this tutorial takes the form of a critical survey of the existing methods with an emphasis on articulating the challenges in large-scale global optimization in order to stimulate further research interest in this area.<br>

                <h3>Tutorial 3</h3>
                Title: Genetic Programming: Recent Developments and Applications <br>
                Presenter: Prof. Mengjie Zhang<br>
                Contact Information: School of Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, mengjie.zhang@ecs.vuw.ac.nz<br>
                Abstract:<br>
                One of the central challenges of computer science is to use a computer to do what needs to be done without telling it/knowing the specific process. Genetic programming (GP) addresses this challenge by providing a method for automatically creating a working computer program from a high-level statement of a specific task. GP achieves this goal by genetically breeding a population of computer programs using the principles of Darwinian natural selection and biologically inspired operations. This tutorial will start with an overview of GP principles, including representation, operators, search mechanisms and the evolutionary process. It will then discuss the most popular applications of GP with a focus on the evolved "models" and "generalisation" on symbolic regression and mathematical modelling, classification and clustering, and feature selection and construction. The tutorial will also discuss with some interesting demonstrations and "deep [learning] program structures" in image recognition. If time allows, a discussion will be made on GP as a hyper-heuristic technique for dynamic job shop scheduling.<br>

                <h3>Tutorial 4</h3>
                Title: Evolutionary Computation and Complex Networks <br>

                Abstract:<br>
                Both evolutionary computation and complex networks have received considerable attention in recent years. Applications of complex networks to the field of evolutionary computation have received considerable attention from the research community. The majority of work studies attempts using complex networks, such as small-world and scale-free networks, as the underlying population architecture in evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, complex networks are also used to analyze fitness landscapes and designing predictive problem difficulty measures. Simultaneously, EAs were also used to solve optimization problems in the field of complex networks, such as community detection problems, network robustness optimization problems, and network reconstruction. Since both evolutionary computation and complex networks cover a wide range of research fields, instead of treating each field in isolation, this tutorial focuses on the research combining these two fields; that is, focuses on introducing the interlink between evolutionary computation and complex networks, and the advantages of combining these two fields.<br>

                <h3>Tutorial 5</h3>
                Title: Algorithm Selection – Online + Offline Techniques<br>
                Presenter: Prof. Mustafa MISIR<br>
                Contact Information: Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, College of Computer Science and Technology, 29 Jiangjun Avenue, 211106 Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, mmisir@nuaa.edu.cn<br>
                Abstract:<br>
                Experimental studies show that there is no single algorithm that performs the best on all possible benchmarks, as also revealed by the No free lunch theorem. While an algorithm works well on a group of problem instances, it performs poorly on some others. One way to overcome this issue is to combine the strengths of multiple algorithms. This is possible by utilizing a system that can pick, hopefully, the best algorithm(s) for each target problem instance. Algorithm (portfolio) selection (AS) is the field aiming at automatically performing this task. AS has been usually applied through performance prediction models that can tell the performance of an existing algorithm on an unseen problem instance. In terms of AS, the selection operations are done in an Offline manner, thus the algorithms to be applied are chosen prior to they are being used. In addition to the traditional AS, Online AS has also been studied. Online refers to when AS takes place while a problem instance is being solved. Online AS has been referred under different names mainly including Selection Hyper-heuristics (SHHs) and Adaptive Operator Selection (AOS). SHHs have been studied to deliver problem-independent solvers which are applicable to any combinatorial search problems. AOS has been referred to mainly for choosing the operators under Evolutionary Algorithms while they have been additionaly used under SHHs.

The present tutorial will cover 1) Offline AS; 2) Online AS; and 3) Online + Offline AS. Each form of AS will be discussed with a formal description, an overview of the existing approaches together with a few case studies.<br>

                <h3>Tutorial 6</h3>
                Title: Hybrid Metaheuristics for Semiconductor Scheduling<br>
                Presenter: Prof. Mitsuo Gen<br>
                Contact Information: Fuzzy Logic Systems Institute and Tokyo University of Science, Japan<br>
                Abstract:<br>
                Many combinatorial optimization problems (COP) in the real world manufacturing systems impose on more complex issues, such as complex structure, nonlinear constraints, and multiple objectives to be handled simultaneously and make the problem intractable to the traditional approaches because of NP-hard COP. In order to develop an efficient solution algorithm that is in a sense "best solution" that is, whose reasonable computational time for NP-hard combinatorial problems met in practice, we have to consider the following very important issues:<br>
                - Quality of solution,<br>
                - Computational time and<br>
                - Effectiveness of the nondominated solutions for multiobjective optimization problem (MOP).<br>
                Evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of metaheuristics, a generic population-based metaheuristic such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). EA is based on principles from evolution theory, and it is very powerful and broadly applicable stochastic search and combinatorial optimization technique which is effective for solving various NP hard COP models.<br>
                This tutorial talk will be firstly introduced a brief survey of several metaheuristics based on EA such as GA, hybrid GA (HGA), multiobjective GA (MoGA), PSO and EDA for applying to various combinatorial optimization problems in real world semiconductor manufacturing systems. Secondly real applications based on hybrid metaheuristics will summarize the following recent semiconductor manufacturing scheduling topics:<br>
                1. HGA and PSO+GA for Reentrant Flowshop Scheduling in HDD Manufacturing Scheduling<br>
                2. Mo-HGA with TOPSIS for TFT-LCD Module Assembly Scheduling<br>
                3. Cooperative EDA for Semiconductor Final Testing Scheduling<br>
                4. Hybrid EDA with multi-subpopulation for Semiconductor Manufacturing Scheduling<br>
