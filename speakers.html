            <h4>Prof. Sanaz Mostaghim</h4>
            <b>Title of talk</b>: Multi-Objective Optimiztaion and Decision Making in Dynamic Environments<br>
            <b>Abstract</b>: <br>
            This talk is about multi-objective optimization and decision making algorithms in industrial applications. The talk will give an overview about the design issues for multi-objective optimization algorithms and the challenges in real-time applications such as in robotics and computer games. In most of such applications, the decision maker must find and select one possible optimal solution in a very limited time frame. This is very challenging, when the environment dynamically changes as the decision maker needs to re-optimize and decide on the fly. Multi-objective decision making algorithms in dynamically changing environments will be addressed and applications in computer games and robotics using flying robots will be presented.<br>

            <b>Title of talk</b>: Broad Learning System (宽度学习): An effective and efficient incremental learning system without the need for deep architecture<br>
            <b>Abstract</b>: <br>
            In recent years, deep learning caves out a research wave in machine learning. With outstanding performance, more and more applications of deep learning in pattern recognition, image recognition, speech recognition, and video processing have been developed. The talk is to introduce “Broad Learning”-- a very fast and accurate learning without the need of deep structure. Without stacking the layer-structure, the designed neural networks expand the neural nodes broadly and update the weights of the neural networks incrementally when additional nodes are needed and when the input data entering to the neural networks continuously. The designed network structure and learning algorithm are perfectly suitable for modeling and learning big data environment. Experiments results in MNIST and handwriting recognition and NORB database indicate that the proposed BLS significantly outperforms existing deep structures in learning accuracy and generalization ability.<br>

            <h4>Prof. Hisao Ishibuchi</h4>
            <b>Title of talk</b>: Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization and Performance Evaluation<br>
            <b>Abstract</b>: <br>
            This talk starts with brief introduction to evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Next we discuss difficulties in several aspects related to evolutionary many-objective optimization such as the search for Pareto optimal solutions, the approximation of the Pareto front, the visualization of obtained non-dominated solutions, and the selection of a single final solution. After that, we discuss difficulties of fair performance comparison of EMO (evolutionary multi-objective optimization) algorithms especially for man-objective problems. It is demonstrated that hypervolume-based performance comparison results strongly depend on the choice of a reference point. Only when the shape of the Pareto front is triangular, the effect of the reference point specification is limited to m extreme points of the Pareto front of an m-objective optimization problem. Then we discuss how to specify a reference point for fair performance comparison. This discussion is related to the reference point specification in hypervolume-based EMO algorithms. Finally we discuss difficulties of performance comparison based on the IGD (inverted generational distance) indicator.<br>

            <b>Title of talk</b>: Class Imbalance Learning -- Problem, Modelling and Challenges<br>
            <b>Abstract</b>: <br>
            In many practical problems, number of data form difference classes can be quite imbalanced, which could make the performance of the most machine learning methods become deteriorate to a certain degree. As far as we know, the problem of learning from imbalanced data continues to be one of the challenges in the field of data engineering and machine learning, which has attracted growing attentions in recent years. In this talk, we will first formally describe the class imbalance problem and its significance with examples from real world applications, and review the existing solutions. Then, three research problems, i.e. sampling strategy, classifier weights of boosting and imbalanced streaming data with concept drift, are studied. Accordingly, we have proposed a solution for each problem. The first solution, namely Hybrid Sampling with Bagging (HSBagging) method, utilizes a new hybrid scheme of undersampling and oversampling with sampling rate selection. This method features both of undersampling and oversampling, and the specifically selected sampling rate for each data set. The second solution is called G-mean Optimized Boosting (GOBoost), which is a boosting framework where the classifier weights are optimized on geometric mean measurement. GOBoost is an ensemble framework that can be applied to any boosting-based method for class imbalance learning by simply replacing the classifier weights updating module. The last solution is called Dynamic Weighted Majority for Imbalance Learning (DWMIL). It creates a base classifier for each chunk and weighs them according to their performance evaluated on the current chunk. Thus, a classifier trained recently or on the similar concept to the current chunk will receive high weight in the ensemble to help prediction. Finally, some challenging problems in this topic are explored as well.<br>
